> To be sure, man's search for meaning may arouse inner tension rather than inner equilibrium. However, precisely such tension is an indispensable prerequisite of mental health. (…) There is much wisdom in the words of Nietzsche: “He who as a _why_ to leave for can bear almost any _how_.”

> What man actually need is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task. (…) What man needs is not homeostasis but what I call “noö-dynamics” i.e. (…) [when] architects want to strengthen a decrepit arch, they _increase_ the load which is laid upon it, for thereby the parts are joined more firmly together.

> Having shown the beneficial impact of meaning orientation, I turn to the detrimental influence of that feeling of which so many patients complain today, namely, the feeling of the total and ultimate meaninglessness of their lives. They lack the awareness of a meaning worth leaving for. They are haunted by the experience of their inner emptiness, a void within themselves; they are caught in that situation which I have called the “existential vacuum”.

> No instinct tells him what he has to do, and no tradition tells him what he ought to do; sometimes he does not even know what he wishes to do. Instead, he either wishes to do what other people do (conformism) or he does what other people wish him to do (totalitarism).

> What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person's life at a given moment. (…) Thus, everyone's task is as unique as is his specific opportunity to implement it.

> This emphasis on responsibleness is reflected in the categorical imperative of logotherapy, which is: “Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!” It seems to me that there is nothing which would stimulate a man's sense of responsibleness more than this maxim (…).

> According to logotherapy, we can discover this meaning in life in three different ways:
> 1. by creating a work or doing a deed;
> 1. by experiencing something or encountering someone;
> 1. and by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering.
> The second way of finding a meaning in life is by experiencing something—such as goodness, trught and beauty—by experiencing nature and culture or, last but not least, by experiencing another in his very uniqueness—by loving him.

> We must never forget that we may also find meaning in life even when confronted with a hopeless situation, when facing a fate that cannot be changed. For what then matters is to bear witness to the uniquely human potential at its best, which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph, to turn one's predicament into a human achievement. When we are no longer able to change a situation—just think of an incurable disease such as an inoperable cancer—we are challenged to change ourselves.

> Those things which seem to take meaning away from human life include not only suffering but dying as well. I never tire of saying that the only really transitory aspects of life are the potentialities (…).

> Logotherapy bases its technique called “paradoxical intention” on the twofold fact that fear brings about that which one is afraid of, and that hyper-intention makes impossible what one wishes.

> By [pandeterminism] I mean the view of the man which disregards his capacity to take a stand toward any condition whatsoever. Man is _not_ fully conditioned and determined but rather determines himself wether he gives in to conditions or stands up to them. In other words, man is ultimately self-determining.
