**Thomas Parisot** is my full name and people often call me *Tom*.
My long lasting nickname *Oncle Tom* is a friendly pun to our *digital slavery*.

I am a french _Software Designer_, part of the [dtc innovation][] co-op.
We created this small and safe environment to design valuable projects with our customers. We help making these projects _open source_ and _open data_ compliant.

My body of work revolves around challenging project briefs, collaborating on web softwares and engaging with audiences to design meaningful projects.

I used to work at [BBC R&D][]. I used to be a volunteer at [Organic Lea farm][]. And I used to co-organise the [Sud Web][] event.


## Values

I highly believe in **empowerment**, **kindness** and **openness**.

Hence I will do my best to favour **non-profit**, **ethical** or **greater good** projects and organisations.


## Professional experience

I have **more than 10 years of professional experience** in the web industry through various roles and responsibilities:

- *Software designer* at [dtc innovation][] co-op;
- *Senior web engineer* at [BBC R&D][];
- *CTO* and *co-founder* of [Dijiwan, a startup which failed](/2014/why-our-startup-failed/);
- *Web consultant* in my own limited company;
- *Web consultant* at [Clever Age][], a renowned French Web engineering agency;
- *Web developer* in a nation-wide retail group.
